# Craftsmanship Tribe
This repository serves as a centralized hub for a wide range of educational materials and resources specifically 
designed to support the learning journey of the Craftsmanship Tribe.

## Workshops

### Software Testing by Example

A live coding session where we'll break down the testing pyramid into layers, explore the benefits and drawbacks of 
each, and apply them to a bank looking to expand its product offerings across different regions.

### Introduction to Test-Driven Development by Example

Building on the previous workshop, we'll dive deeper into the application of test-driven development (TDD) and its 
various approaches. Using the same bank application as before, we'll demonstrate how to build new features while 
ensuring code quality and test coverage.

### Extending Spaghetti Code with New Features by Example

We've all had to deal with untested spaghetti codebases, and it's not always easy to know whether to rebuild or add new 
features incrementally. In this session, we'll show you an incremental approach that avoids a complete rewrite or makes 
the current solution even more complex in one single step.

### Introduction to Hexagonal Architecture and Its Use-Cases

If you're already comfortable with the dependency inversion principle and Clean Architecture, prepare for a new 
perspective. We'll explore different code structuring methods and real-life examples of Hexagonal Architecture in 
action.

### Introduction to Extreme Programming

Extreme Programming (XP) may be an older idea, but it's still a game-changer for many developers. We'll take a deep dive 
into XP's benefits, including Continuous Integration, testing, and day-to-day operations. Discover how your team can 
harness XP to gain a competitive edge.
